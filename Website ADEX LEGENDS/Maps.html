          <div class="inner">
            <p>One of the tallest buildings in Malta is the fully automated Hammond Manufacturing Tower, but its rooftop is left exposed due to its height and lack of human presence. Brought together by a mutual hatred for big Outland corporations, Arenas fighters covertly commandeer the place at night for fierce Arena matches under the smoggy skies. It’s a win-win for all groups involved, with an added element of danger for the participants and profits made on Hammond's property right under their nose.</p>

            <p>Found on the planet Boreas, Encore is the Arena where Seer made his name. Treated as a cursed outcast after being blamed for his planet’s moon being struck by a meteor, he slowly gathered a following of outsiders who would come to watch him compete. Over time, the Encore Arena became more and more designed to reflect the style of its star competitor.</p>

            <p>After trace amounts of Branthium were discovered in magma flows on Talos, Hammond Robotics began aggressively pursuing various means of mining it. One was an automated processing rig--officially referred to as Hephaestus Station, it’s affectionately referred to as Overflow. It hasn't seen any human activity for the majority of its operation, but after its spacious platforms caught the eyes of the Arenas organizers, it began doing double-duty as an industrial mining operation and a site for chaotic combat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <div class="inner">
            <p>Once a simple settlement on the planet Solace, the island known as Kings Canyon didn't thrive until the IMC chose it as a hub for research and development. It housed an airbase, a water treatment plant, and a plethora of other facilities to support the IMC's operations - like a highly classified project on the function of Phase tech, or a radical program to create a simulacra army powered by a single brain. But on the surface, Kings Canyon seemed like a simple IMC installation that, for all its faults, brought stability and jobs to Solace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <div class="inner">
            <p>Once a city built on dreams, Olympus was a utopia floating in clouds above Psamathe. Here, the brightest minds in the Outlands could gather and exchange ideas, leading to breakthroughs in the sciences and arts. However, an accident in an experimental research facility led to the creation of the Phase Rift (a massive bubble of Phase energy), and the Outlands' best and brightest quickly abandoned the city. With the support of the Mercenary Syndicate, Hammond Robotics stepped in to transform Olympus into a new stage for the Apex Games.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <div class="inner">
            <p>This deserted island wasn't always so deserted. Beautiful and teeming with resources, Storm Point was the prime candidate for early IMC expeditions to planet Gaea. However, IMC settlement teams quickly discovered that intense tropical storms plague the island and a permanent settlement was established nearby-the city of Suotamo. As the city grew, the IMC built power-generating storm catchers on Storm Point to keep up with their energy needs.</p>
